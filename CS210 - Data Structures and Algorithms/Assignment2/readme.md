# CS-210 Assignment 2

**Description**
* This problem requires you to write a program to convert an infix expression to postfix format. The
evaluation of an infix expression such as A + B * C requires knowledge of which of the two operations, +
or *, should be performed first. In general, A + B * C is to be interpreted as A + (B * C) unless otherwise
specified. We say that multiplication takes precedence over addition. Suppose that we would now like
to convert A + B * C to postfix. Applying the rules of precedence, we begin by converting the first
portion of the expression that is evaluated, namely, the multiplication operation.
