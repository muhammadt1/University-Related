**Class Description** 
This course focuses on the concepts of object-oriented programming. Topics include data abstraction, classes, composition and inheritance, subtyping, dynamic binding, polymorphism and dynamic memory management. Other topics include type systems, two-dimensional arrays, records, references, searching and sorting algorithms, language translation. Software engineering: comprehensibility, correctness, efficiency, refactoring.
=======
This repository contains the source code for assignments related to the concepts of object-oriented programming covered in the CS115 course.

**Assignments Overview**
* Over the course of the term, students  develop a console program that will play Go against the user. The board will be printed using ASCII characters before each move, and the user will enter moves as letter-number pairs.  After each move the computer will make a move, and the updated board will be printed again.

## Assignments Description

### Go Console Program

Over the course of the term, you will be working on developing a console program that plays the game of Go against the user. The program features include:

- The board is printed using ASCII characters before each move.
- The user will enter moves as letter-number pairs.
- After each user move, the computer will make a move.
- The updated board will be printed again.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized based on the principles of object-oriented programming, ensuring a clean and modular structure for the assignments.
